# CIS-3310-Project1

For the first project and it's deliverable, I made a set of pages where the user will be given a different number depending on the output. First, the user will be guided to click a dropdown button from the drop down bar. It will then send them to a page prompting the user to input their name and to provide a number. The javascript will calculate the number by 42 as it is the answer to the universe. The HTML page will provide the output inside a div styled to look like a red box that will display the result. The HTML page will also generate a link that will send the user to the first page. 

If the user desires, they will be given different outputs that can populate the rest of the HTML page.
